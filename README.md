Recipes for AutoPkg (https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg).

The recipes for Keka and Scribus are just Munki importers for download recipes by @hansen_m, so you'll have to add his autopkg repo (https://github.com/autopkg/hansen-m-recipes.git) to your autopkg repo list, before the munki recipes for Keka and Scribus will work.
